# tv-script-rnn
This project generates a Seinfeld (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV script using RNNs. 
It uses part of the Seinfeld dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  
The Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
This represents the RNN projects from the great Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree : https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101 
For more information and examples see this awesome repo: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch 


The helper functions and unit tests have been provided by Udacity team.
